# Introduction
Yes! It's a Harry Potter reference - Except Wand here is German for wall. The Elder Wand application is designed to assist caregivers in managing meal preferences for elderly residents. It offers a comprehensive interface that tracks favourite foods, disliked foods, allergies, and special instructions. This application aims to streamline the meal planning process, ensuring that each resident's dietary needs and preferences are met with care and precision.
By providing an organised and user-friendly platform, the Elder Wand application helps caregivers deliver personalised meal plans, enhancing the overall dining experience for elderly residents. This not only improves the quality of care but also ensures that residents' dietary restrictions and preferences are respected and adhered to their concerns.

## Purpose
Imagine yourself working as a caretaker in an Old Age Home - How strenuous your work day would be? Managing the demands of every resident, remembering their preferences, documenting it manually - on paper? It's just one aspect out of many exhausting tasks they have to perform. But if we could make it one step simpler for them, then why not? This app is meant to do exactly the same - Make it easier for caregivers to record all the meal preferences of each resident.
I connected with caregivers from two different old age homes in my hometown and I was able to empathize with them. They told me how they had to remember of keep everything in files. I was difficult to maintain a file for each resident and each time the likes and dislikes of residents changed. I understood that working as a caretaker in an Old Age Home can be incredibly demanding and emotionally taxing. Hence, a step towards making someone's daily work a bit easier - A small magic with Elder Wand.

## Target Audience
Caretakers or relatives of elderly people.

# Key Features
- **Meal Preferences Management**: Caregivers can manage meal preferences for elderly residents, including tracking favourite foods, disliked foods, allergies, and special instructions.
- **Favourite Foods Management**: Foods can be categorised by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks). Users can add, edit, and remove favourite foods, and use quick-add options for common items.
- **Disliked Foods Tracking**: The app tracks foods that should be avoided, including the name of the food, severity level (mild, moderate, severe), and reason for avoidance. Users can add, edit, and remove disliked foods.
- **Allergy Management**: Allergies are tracked with the name of the allergen, severity level, and potential reaction. Each allergy can be added, edited, or removed as needed.
- **Special Instructions**: A dedicated section for any additional dietary instructions or notes, which can be updated as needed.
- **User Interface Features**: The app has a mobile-responsive design with specialised layouts for smaller screens, interactive forms with validation, quick-add functionality for common items, save draft capability for work in progress, a notification system to confirm changes, and grouped organisation of foods by meal type.

# User Interface Features
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. This includes specialised layouts for smaller screens, making it easy for caregivers to access and manage meal preferences on the go.
- **Interactive Forms**: The application features interactive forms to ensure that all necessary information is entered. This helps ensures that the data is accurate and complete.
- **Quick-Add Functionality for Common Items**: To streamline the process of adding meal preferences, the application includes quick-add options for common items. This allows caregivers to quickly add frequently used foods, such as oatmeal or scrambled eggs, without having to enter all the details manually
- **Save Draft Capability**: The application allows caregivers to save their work in progress as drafts. This means that they can start entering information and come back to it later without losing any data. This feature is particularly useful for busy caregivers who may need to attend to other tasks.
- **Notification System**: A notification system is in place to confirm when changes have been made and saved. This provides caregivers with immediate feedback, ensuring that they know their updates have been successfully recorded.
- **Grouped Organisation**: The application organises foods by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) to make it easier for caregivers to manage and plan meals. This grouped organisation helps caregivers quickly find and update the relevant information.
- **Color Palette**: The application features a warm color scheme designed to reduce eye strain, allowing caregivers to use it comfortably even when fatigued. This helps ease visual stress for users who are often already exhausted.
